# CARLA Vehicle 2D Bounding Box Annotation Module

Tested on CARLA 0.9.10.1

This repo contains several python file that can be used to automatically create 2D counding box for vehicles from a camera view point in CARLA Simulator. To  use this, you need to import `carla_vehicle_annotator.py` to your python code and use the available functions. The other provided files are used to do supporting tasks that will be explained in this file.

**IMPORTANT.** Some parts of the provided code are not made by me and copied from CARLA example code. CARLA Simulator and its example code are licenced under the terms of MIT Licence. For more information about CARLA, I highly recommend you to visit their website https://carla.org.

## `carla_vehicle_annotator.py`

There are several functions that is provided in this module. However, you only need these main functions to make this module works properly.

### `result, object_points = auto_annotate_lidar(vehicles, camera, lidar_data, max_dist = 100, min_detect = 5, show_img = None, json_path = None)`

This function process the vehicles and semantic lidar information and retrieve the 2D bounding box pixel coordinates for each visible vehicle with the corresponding vehicle’s class. This function gives a more stable result than `auto_annotate`.

Arguments:
- **`vehicles` (list of `carla.Actor` or `carla.ActorSnapShot`):** list that contains vehicle actors/snapshots that you want to consider. You can pass list of all vehicles that have been spawned in Carla world. If you pass vehicles' snapshot, make sure that you add `bounding_box` and `type_id` instances to the snapshot. Use `snap_processing` function to add the instances automatically.
- **`camera` (`carla.Sensor`):** the RGB camera object (carla sensor).
- **`lidar_data` (`carla.SemanticLidarMeasurement`):** the measurement results of the semantic LIDAR
- **`max_dist` (`float` ; default 100):** the maximum distance parameter for distance filter. Increasing this value will allow the function to return vehicles that is located in greater distance, and thus with smaller bounding box.
- **`min_detect` (`int` ; default 5):** the minimum number of lidar points that hit a object to make that object regarded as visible. If you set this value low, objects with a small appearance (soch as significantly occluded objects and objects in long distance) can be detected by this function.
- **`show_img` (`carla.Image` ; default None):** you can pass a carla camera output to this argument. if you do that, the function will create a image of lidar points that are projected to the image provided in this argument. Point that hit a dynamic object will be colored black while the others white. The images will be saved inside a folder named `out_lidar_img`. This might be useful for debugging purpose.
- **`json_path` (`string` ; default None):** the JSON .txt path that contains vehicle types classification (ex: *‘/vehicle_class_json_file.txt’*). This argument must be filled if you want to assign a class label to each vehicle. Read explanation about vehicle_class_json_creator.py for information about labeling. Set this to None if you don’t need the label.

Return:
- **`result` (dictionary):** python dictionary that contains the bounding boxes, vehicle actors, and the corresponding label of the visible vehicles. Key - values of this output is the same as `result` output from `auto_annotate`
- **`object_points` (list of `carla.SemanticLidarDetection`):** the list of lidar semantic data that hit a dynamic object

Notes:
- Make sure that the semantic lidar and RGB camera have the same attributes and transformation, and their data are taken in the same time.
- An example of the usage of this function can be seen in `test_semantic_lidar.py`.
- Be aware that since lidar data is a sparse data when projected into camera view, there will be some regions in camera view that are not touched by LIDAR. You can increase the number of channel of the LIDAR to make the data more dense vertically, or increase the number of points per second to make the data more dense horizontally. Use debugging feature provided by argument show_img to look at how your lidar points are projected to your camera image.

### `result, removed = auto_annotate(vehicles, camera, depth_img, max_dist=100, depth_margin=-1, patch_ratio=0.5, resize_ratio=0.5, json_path=None)`

This function process the vehicles and depth image information and retrieve the 2D bounding box pixel coordinates for each visible vehicle with the corresponding vehicle’s class.

Arguments:
- **`vehicles` (list of `carla.Actor` or `carla.ActorSnapShot`):** list that contains vehicle actors/snapshots that you want to consider. You can pass list of all vehicles that have been spawned in Carla world. If you pass vehicles' snapshot, make sure that you add `bounding_box` and `type_id` instances to the snapshot. Use `snap_processing` function to add the instances automatically.
- **`camera` (`carla.Sensor`):** the RGB camera object (carla sensor).
- **`depth_img` (`float` 2D numpy array):** the depth map taken from the same view of RGB camera in meter unit. You can get it from the output of depth camera manually or by using `extract_depth` function.
- **`max_dist` (`float` ; default 100):** the maximum distance parameter for distance filter. Increasing this value will allow the function to return vehicles that is located in greater distance, and thus with smaller bounding box. 
- **`depth_margin` (`float` ; defaullt -1):** the depth margin parameter for occlusion filter. If you pass negative value, the depth margin will be vary according to the vehicle’s dimension. Increasing this value can increase the number of positive results, but with more chance of having false positive result.
- **`patch_ratio` (`float` [0,1] ; default 0.5):** the patch ratio parameter for occlusion filter. Incresing this value might reduce the number of positive results, but with more cance of having false negative results.
- **`resize_ratio` (`float` [0,1] ; default 0.5):** the resize ratio parameter for occlusion filter. Set this to 1 if you don’t want to resize the bounding box for depth measurement.
- **`json_path` (`string` ; default None):** the JSON .txt path that contains vehicle types classification (ex: *‘/vehicle_class_json_file.txt’*). This argument must be filled if you want to assign a class label to each vehicle. Read explanation about vehicle_class_json_creator.py for information about labeling. Set this to None if you don’t need the label.

Return:
- **`result` (dictionary):** python dictionary that contains the bounding boxes, vehicle actors, and the corresponding label of the visible vehicles.
- **`removed` (dictionary):** python dictionary that contains the bounding boxes, vehicle actor, and the corresponding label of the vehicles that are removed by the occlusion filter. 

The result and removed dictionaries contain the following keys - values:
- key: `"vehicles"` - value (list of `carla.Actor`): the list of vehicle actors.
- key: `"bbox"` - value (list of `int` 2D numpy array): the list of bounding boxes where each bounding box represented by two (min and max) corner points (in (x,y) format) of the box. The i-th element of the list is the bounding box for i-th vehicle in `"vehicles"`.
- key: `"class"` - value (list of `int`): the list of vehicle class. The i-th element of the list is the class label for i-th vehicle in `"vehicles"`.

Notes:
- The bounding boxes resulted by this function is less stable than the one provided by `auto_annotate_lidar`
- Make sure that the depth camera and RGB camera have the same attributes and transformation, and their data are taken in the same time.
- An example of the usage of this function can be seen in `collectData.py`.
- If you find that the bounding box algorithm's performance is not satisfying, try to change the value of filter parameters: `depth_margin`, `patch_ratio`, `resize_ratio`.
- You might wonder why you need the removed bounding boxes. The occlusion filter is not 100% accurate. Therefore, you might want to have the list bounding boxes removed by the occlusion filter so that you can return the removed bounding box if you find that it is a false removal.

### `void save_output(carla_img, bboxes, vehicle_class=None, old_bboxes=None, old_vehicle_class=None, cc_rgb=carla.ColorConverter.Raw, path=‘’, save_patched=False, add_data=None, out_format=‘pickle’)`

Use this function to save the result of `auto_annotate` into your local directory. This function will save the RGB image and RGB image with drawn bounding boxes in .jpg format and the bounding boxes information in JSON .txt or pickle format.

Arguments:
- **`carla_img` (`carla.Image`):** object (carla image) returned by the RGB camera at the time the bounding boxes are calculated.
- **`bboxes` (list of `float` 2D numpy array):** list of bounding boxes coordinates that you want to save. You can get it from the returned value `result` of `auto_annotate` or `auto_annotate_lidar` with key `"bbox"`.
- **`vehicle_class` (list of `int` ; default None):** the list of visible vehilcles’ class. You can get it from the returned value `result` of `auto_annotate` or `auto_annotate_lidar` with key `"class"`. Set this to None if you don’t want to save this information. 
- **`old_bboxes` (list of `int` 2D numpy array ; default None):** list of bounding boxes that are removed by the occlusion filter. You can get it from the returned value `removed` of `auto_annotate` with key `"bbox"`. Set this to None if you don’t want to save this information.
- **`old_vehicle_class` (list of `int` ; default None):** the list of vehicles’ class that are removed by the occlusion filter. You can get it from the returned value `removed` of `auto_annotate` with key `"class"`. Set this to None if you don’t want to save this information.
- **`cc_rgb` (`carla.ColorConverter` ; default `carla.ColorConverter.Raw`):** image color style that you want to use for the RGB image.
- **`path` (string ; default ‘’)**: the folder path where you want to save the result (ex: *‘/this/path/‘*).
- **`save_patched` (`bool` ; default False):** set this to True if you want to save the image with drawn bounding boxes.
- **`add_data` (any ; default None)**: fill this argument if you want to save any other additional information.
- **`out_format` (string ; default ‘pickle’)**: the file format to save the result and removed bounding boxes and class and also the additional information `add_data`. Only support *‘json’* (.txt) and *‘pickle’* (.pkl). Any format you choose, this information will be packed as python dictionary when you import the file to your python program.

This function will create three folders in `path`, which are *out_rgb* that contains RGB image, *out_bbox* that contains bounding boxes and other data formatted in pickle or JSON, and *out_rgb_bbox* that contains RGB image with drawn bounding boxes. Folder *out_rgb_bbox* will only be created if you set parameter `save_patched` to True. Data taken from the same moment are named with the same name in these three folders, so that you can find which bounding boxes file that corresponds to which image easily. Information that packed in *out_bbox*’s files are packed as python dictionary. This dictionary contains these keys - values:
- key: `"bboxes"` - value: data passed to `bboxes` argument
- key: `"vehicle_class"` - value: data passed to `vehicle_class` argument
- key: `"removed_bboxes"` - value: data passed to `old_bboxes` argument
- key: `"removed_vehicle_class"` - value: data passed to `old_vehicle_class` argument
- key: `"others"` - value: data passed to `add_data` argument

Notes:
- Make sure you put ending slash *‘/‘* behind the folder path that you pass into `path` argument.
- If you want to save bounding boxes data in JSON format, make sure data that you passed to `add_data` argument (if any) is compatible with JSON format.

### `void save2darknet(bboxes, vehicle_class, carla_img, data_path = '', cc_rgb = carla.ColorConverter.Raw, save_train = False, customName = '')`

This function will save your images and the corresponding bounding boxes according to darknet's training data format, so you can use it for ,as example, train your YOLOv4 model. For more information about darknet and its data format, I recommend you to visit darknet github.

Arguments:
- **`bboxes` (list of `float` 2D numpy array):** list of bounding boxes coordinates that you want to save. You can get it from the returned value `result` of `auto_annotate` or `auto_annotate_lidar` with key `"bbox"`.
- **`vehicle_class` (list of `int` ; default None):** the list of visible vehilcles’ class. You can get it from the returned value `result` of `auto_annotate` or `auto_annotate_lidar` with key `"class"`.
- **`carla_img` (`carla.Image`):** object (carla image) returned by the RGB camera at the time the bounding boxes are calculated.
- **`data_path` (`string` ; default `''`):** path where `darknet.exe` is located. It should be located in `[DARKNET_PATH]/build/darknet/x64/`. This function willl create new folder `/data` (relative to `data_path`) that contains folder `obj` and file `train.txt` (if you set `save_train` to True).
- **`cc_rgb` (`carla.ColorConverter` ; default `carla.ColorConverter.Raw`):** image color style that you want to use for the RGB image.
- **`save_train` (`bool` ; default `False`):** set this value to `True` if you want to create `train.txt` file in `/data`. If set this to true, this function will scan all JPG files that exist in `/data/obj/` and will recreate `train.txt` according to the detected JPG files. Therefore I suggest you to use this feature only in the end of your data aggregation process. You can set `bboxes`,`vehicle_class` or `carla_img` to None if you want to use this feature without creating new training data.
- **`customName` (`string` ; default `''`):** string passed to this argument will be added to the image name. The output image's name format will be `customName_frameNumber.jpg`. If this argument is set to default, the output image's name format will be `frameNumber.jpg`.

Notes:
- You have to create `obj.names` and `obj.names` manually.
- Remember that the bounding boxes created by this module is not 100% accurate. Therefore, I recommend you to use [this program](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark) provided by darknet to review or edit the bounding boxes.

### `depth_meter = extract_depth(depth_img)`

Use this function to convert depth `carla.Image` that you get from depth camera into depth map in meter unit, so that you can pass it to `auto_annotate` function.

Argument:
- **`depth_img` (`carla.Image`)**: carla image object that come from depth sensor measurement

Return:
- **`depth_meter` (`float` 2D numpy array)**: depth map of the corresponding input in meter unit.

### `vehicles = snap_processing(vehiclesActor, worldSnap)`

Use this function to add `bounding_box` and `type_id` instances to vehicles snapshot based on actual vehicles actor data.

Argument:
- **`vehiclesActor` (list of `carla.Actor`)**: list of vehicle actors that you are interested in, which you can get from `carla.world.get_actors` function.
- **`worldSnap` (`carla.WorldSnapshot`)**: The world snapshot that contains your vehicles snapshot.

Return:
- **`vehicles` (list of `carla.ActorSnapshot`)**: List of snapshot of vehicles that exist in both `vehiclesActor` and `worldSnap`. The snapshots have two additional instances, which are `bounding_box` and `type_id` that are taken from actor information.

## `test_draw_bb.py`

Run this program to test how the algorithm in `auto_annotate` works. This program will load interactive window that contains view from a car camera perspective. You can control the car manually so that you can evaluate the performance of the algorithm directly. You can change the values of filter parameters and see how changing these parameters can effect the performance of the filter.

## `vehicle_class_json_creator.py`

Run this program to create *vehicle_class_json_file.txt*. This file is a JSON formatted data that map each vehicle types available in Carla to one integer label. Definition of each label is also packed in the JSON file. The default label mapping file has been provided in my repo. But you can create your own label mapping file by running and edit this program.

This program has two variables that you can modify. One of them is `autoFill`, which if you set to True, the program will automatically create mapping file that maps all vehicle types to class label 0. The other one is `class_ref`, which is a dictionary that defines the definition of each class label. After you run the program (if `autoFill` is set to False), check your Carla window and it will show each vehicle types. All you have to do is type the vehicle’s class in your python window. I think it is quite intuitive.

## `test_lidar_data.py`

This program is an example of implementation of `auto_annotate_lidar` function. This program will capture RGB camera and semantic LIDAR data every 1 second in simulation time.

## `collectData.py`

This program is an example of implementation of `auto_annotate` function. This program will capture sensors data every 1 second in simulation time. The sensors are RGB camera (with Bounding Box), depth camera, segmentation camera, and LIDAR camera. If you think that the bounding box results is poor, you can change the filter parameters in `auto_annotate` function to get better result. 

That’s all I have for you. Have fun with CARLA and keep supporting CARLA project. Thank you.
